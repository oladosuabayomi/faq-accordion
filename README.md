## Features

- Users can hide/show answers to questions by clicking on them.
- Interactive hover and focus states for better user experience.
- Responsive design optimized for both mobile and desktop screens.
- Accessible keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structure.
- **CSS** with:
  - Flexbox for layout.
  - Relative units for responsiveness.
  - `:root` property to define reusable variables.
- **JavaScript** for interactivity.

## What I Learned

1. Gained more confidence in using **CSS Flexbox** for responsive layouts.
2. Explored defining styles using the `:root` property, which improved code maintainability.
3. Navigated through challenges in **JavaScript implementation** to make the accordion functional.

## Challenges Faced

While the CSS portion was manageable, implementing the JavaScript functionality was a bit tasking. However, it provided a great learning opportunity, and with persistence, I got everything to work as intended.
